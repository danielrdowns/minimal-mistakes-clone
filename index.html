'For some time, I've been meaning to set up this website as a repository for the variety of projects, resources, and creative works I've been involved in and would like to share with the world. The goal of the website is to be a sort of digital portfolio or "living CV" - a dynamic and constantly evolving home to document completed endeavors, useful links, and works-in-progress. Itâ€™s still very much a thing in progress, but I do hope you'll join me for the ride.'
